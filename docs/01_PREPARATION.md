# 1. Preparation

Before deploying, ensure your project is ready:

- All code is committed to your Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
- Your `package.json` has the correct build scripts:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  }
  ```

- Your application works correctly in the development environment
- You have access to all required API keys and credentials for production
